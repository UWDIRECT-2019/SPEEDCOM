Bypass ab inito requirements with ML.

(UI)
Read in geometry
  As SMILES string ? --> for learning use
	(or IN CHE strings???)  
Display molecule
Communicate to database
Guess the absorption/emission spectrum
Communicate back to client
Display the resulting spectrum

(Backend)
--learning--
Read in experimental spectra
  from folder

Determine energy/intensity of peaks
  Set intensity into units?

Learn intensities/ excitation energies

Validation section
	Pseudo-random breaking up of dataset

--Normal operation--
Retrieve geometry from client
guess spectrum
return spectrum
